Odin - Argentinian Recipes

Hi! I'm Franco ğŸ‘‹, from Argentina ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·.

In this case, I'm glad to show you my homeland's cuisine.

I've made a website with three important dishes in my country, such as "Locro" ğŸ¥˜, "Choripan" ğŸ§† and "Milanesa Napolitana" ğŸ¥©.

I hope you can at least taste one of them.

Enjoy your meal ğŸ˜€!
