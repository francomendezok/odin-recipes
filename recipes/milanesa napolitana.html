    <h2 class="center">Here is the list of ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 beef cutlets, pounded thin</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
        <li>8 oz mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="center">Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
        <li>Season the beef cutlets with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs in three separate shallow bowls.</li>
        <li>Dredge each cutlet in the flour, shaking off any excess, then dip in the beaten eggs, and coat with the breadcrumbs. Press the breadcrumbs onto the cutlets to make sure they adhere.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, add the breaded cutlets and fry for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy. Drain the cutlets on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Transfer the fried cutlets to a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spoon tomato sauce over each cutlet, then top with slices of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with fresh chopped basil before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve the milanesa napolitana hot with your favorite sides, such as crispy fries or mashed potatoes.</li>
